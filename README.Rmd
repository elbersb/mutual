# segregation

[![CRAN Version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/segregation)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=segregation)

An R package to calculate and decompose entropy-based, multigroup segregation indices, with a focus
on the Mutual Information Index (M) and Theil's Information Index (H).

- calculate total, between, within, and local segregation
- decompose differences in total segregation over time
- estimate standard errors via bootstrapping
- every method returns a [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) data frame (or [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org), if the package is installed) for easy post-processing and plotting
- it's fast, because it uses the [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) package internally

## Usage

The package provides an easy way to calculate segregation measures, based on the Mutual Information Index (M) and Theil's Entropy Index (H).

```{r}
library(segregation)
# example dataset with fake data provided by the package
mutual_total(schools00, "race", "school", weight = "n")
```

Standard errors in all functions can be estimated via boostrapping:

```{r}
mutual_total(schools00, "race", "school", weight = "n", se = TRUE)
```

Decompose segregation into a between-state and a within-state term 
(the sum of these equals total segregation):

```{r}
# between states
mutual_total(schools00, "race", "state", weight = "n")

# within states
mutual_total(schools00, "race", "school", within = "state", weight = "n")
```

Local segregation (`ls`) is a decomposition by units (here racial groups).
The sum of the proportion-weighted local segregation scores equals M:

```{r}
(local <- mutual_local(schools00, group = "school", unit = "race", weight = "n", 
             se = TRUE, wide = TRUE))

sum(local$p * local$ls)
```

Decompose the difference in M between 2000 and 2005, 
using the method developed by Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2009):

```{r}
mutual_difference(schools00, schools05, group = "race", unit = "school",
                  weight = "n", method = "mrc")
```

## How to install

To install the package from CRAN, use

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("segregation") 
```

To install the development version, use

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("elbersb/segregation") 
```

To access the documentation ([PDF](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/segregation/segregation.pdf)), type

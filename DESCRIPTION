Description: Computes entropy-based segregation indices, with a focus
    on the Mutual Information Index (M). The M is a measure
    of segregation that is highly decomposable. Provides
    tools to decompose the index by units and groups (local segregation), 
    and by within and between terms. 
    Includes standard error estimation by bootstrapping.

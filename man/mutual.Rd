\title{segregation: Entropy-based segregation indices}
\description{
Computes entropy-based segregation indices, with a focus on
the mutual information index (M). The M is a measure
of segregation that is highly decomposable. Provides
tools to decompose the index by units and groups, and by within
and between terms. Includes standard error estimation by bootstrapping.
